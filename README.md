# ML-in-Biostatistics
This repository contains my independent work from STAT 437 (Methods in Biostatistics) at University of Waterloo.    

Censored data are common in the field of Biostatistics, since patients who survive the length of the experiment are "censored". In a traditional sense, their data can't be meaningfully used to model the effect of a treatment, since their data points can't be measured when the experiment ends.     
I investigated how censoring unbiased regression trees and censoring unbiased regression ensembles can help improve the prediction accuracy in censored data, compared to the default random forest methods as we know, which were originally introduced by Leo Breiman.     

Please refer to **STAT 437 final report** uploaded in this repository for more information.
